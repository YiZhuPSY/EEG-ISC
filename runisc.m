function [ISC,ISC_persubject,ISC_persecond,W,A] = runisc(datafile)
%
% This is matlab code to compute intersubject correlation (ISC) in EEG
% using correlated component analysis, as described in the references below
% (description closest to the present code is in Cohen et al, 2016).
%
% You will need these files to run this code:
%    topoplot.m    -- EEGlab's popular display function. 
%    BioSemi64.loc -- BioSemi location file for topoplot
%    notBoxPlot.m  -- Rob Campbell's scatter plot
%    EEGVolume.mat -- Samantha Cohen's EEG data with 64 electrodes from 18
%                     subjects while watching this video:
%                     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEo-rw2TeAU.
%
% A stand-alone version of these files can be found on the same location as
% this file. Once you have all this the code can be run as:
%
% [ISC,ISC_persubject,ISC_persecond,W,A] = isceeg('EEGVolume.mat');
%
% To understand the format of the data file take a look at lines maked with
% ***. You will have to edit these lines if your data is in a different
% format.
%
% The input to this function is EEG data (volumes of samples by channels by
% subjects). The output are component projection vectors W, scalp
% projections A, and ISC_persubject and ISC_persecond, i.e. the
% intersubject correlation computed resolved for each subject, or resolved
% in time. Components are sorted by how much correlation between subjects
% they capture. We typically only look at the first few, and often just take
% the sum of the first 3 ISC. This is not done in this code.
%
% Parameters of the algorithm are currently set to reasonable defaults.
%
% Curently this is coded assuming a single continuous dynamic stimulus (the
% example data was recored for a video of 197 seconds duration). In
% practice I strongly recommend running this by combining data from
% multiple stimuli to get more robust estimates of the required within- and
% between-subjects covariances. Comments on how to change the code to do
% this are marked with +++
%
% Code for preprocessing EEG and generating surrogate data may be useful in
% other applications and has been separated as sub-functions. 
%
% Surrogate data can be used to test for statistical significance of ISC
% values. However, the code is not currently used for this purpose and is
% only provided as example to generate a single surrogate. See ###
